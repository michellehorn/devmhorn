// About section
export const aboutMe = `Hi, my name is Michelle Horn, I’m a front-end developer, with about 6 years of experience. 
I’m from Florianópolis/BR where I currently live. During my journey, I’ve worked with the top 3 front-end technologies (Angular 2+, Reactjs and Vuejs), 
besides having solid knowledge in base technologies (html, css, javascript). I love the education field and have big involvement with the cause. 
I’m currently working with the company Loft, our solution is an realstate app for buying and selling properties, 
and I’m also involvment with Gama Experience, a project from Gama Academy (where I help as a mentor for new developers during the course). 
Personally, I define myself as a “Nuttela nerd”, cause even tho in love with technology, Star Wars, super heroes and games, 
I also love going to the bar to drink some beer with friends. You can check more about me in the next sections of this website`
